              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>
                The phyllodes tumour is a rare breast tumour, accounting for
                less than 1% of all breast neoplasms[1]. They present as a
                breast lump at any age including adolescence.The peak incidence
                in women is between 35 and 55 years of age, with only a few
                cases reported in men[3]. A large series from the M.D. Anderson
                Cancer Centre reported the incidence of phyllodes tumours
                histologically as benign (58%), intermediate (12%), and
                malignant (30%)[4]. Wide local excision is usually the primary
                approach to treatment. Reoccurrence rate after surgical excision
                is variously described as between 14% and 21% with recurrence
                more likely in those with the tumour at the margins of
                excision[5]. Malignant phyllodes tumours behave like sarcomas
                and can develop blood-borne metastases with a poor prognosis[6].
                Here, a patient diagnosed with metastatic malignant Phyllodes
                Tumour with an unusual presentation is described. The aim
                includes adding information to the relatively small database of
                malignant phyllodes tumour cases reported.

              <h3>Case Report</h3>
              <p>
                A 55 year old lady presented to the OPD with complaints of a
                swelling in left parotid region.  She first noticed the swelling
                about  7 months back and it was gradually increasing in size.
                The swelling was initially painful, but later turned painless.
                There was no increase in size of swelling with meals/difficulty
                in opening of the mouth/difficulty in speech, alteration of
                voice or deviation of the angle of the mouth. She had a history
                of simple mastectomy for right breast 1 and 1/2 years back but
                details of were not available initially. She also had a past
                history of total abdominal hysterectomy 6 years back for
                fibroids. She was on regular analgesics from a local hospital
                for hip pain.
              </p>

              <p>
                General examination was unremarkable but for the antalgic gait
                due to the hip pain. On local examination there was a swelling
                of size 5x4 cm below and slightly in front of lobule of left
                ear, which was raising the ear lobule. It was bony-hard in
                consistency with a smooth surface and well defined borders.
                There were no features of facial nerve involvement /restriction
                of the movements of the jaw/ cervical lymph node enlargement.
                Systemic examination revealed the healed scars of previous
                surgeries, a Pfannenstiel incision scar over lower abdomen and a
                right mastectomy scar. Hip joint movements were restricted by
                pain. Localized tenderness was present over the lumbosacral
                spine. With the above clinical scenario we reached the clinical
                diagnosis of a parotid tumour with a suspicion of malignancy.
              </p>

              <p>
                Upon further investigating the patient, the routine preoperative
                investigations were normal. Patient already had an FNAC of the
                swelling from an outside lab giving a report suggestive of a
                pleomorphic adenoma. The strong clinical suspicion of malignancy
                made us repeat the FNAC; yielding 'Cytology findings of a benign
                neoplasm: Pleomorphic Adenoma to be considered'. We ordered a
                USG of the left parotid region, which was again reported as a
                pleomorphic adenoma.The patient was complaining of severe hip
                pain, for which we ordered an X-ray of the pelvic region that
                showed multiple lytic lesions on the sacrum, L5 vertebrae and
                head and neck of right femur (fig.1,2). The FNAC and USG reports
                seemed contradictory to our clinical findings and we took a CT
                scan of head and neck region, that revealed a 'Heterogeneous
                lytic lesion involving ramus of left mandible, with extension
                into masticator space. Left parotid gland normal and displaced
                posteriorly. A lytic lesion is seen in left scapula'(fig. 3). An
                USG guided FNAC was done and the report came as ‘suggestive of a
                metastasis from a spindle cell neoplasm’. An USG Abdomen showed
                two small hypo-echoic lesions in the segment V of liver,
                possibly metastasis.  In the meantime we were able to collect
                the details of the previous simple mastectomy that was done at
                the Regional Cancer Centre, Thiruvananthapuram; the review of
                histopathology slides was reported as Phyllodes tumour / Spindle
                Cell Carcinoma. We reached a final diagnosis of metastasis from
                a malignant phyllodes tumour. At present she is undergoing
                palliative treatment from our oncology department.

              <h3>Discussion</h3>
              <p>
                Phyllodes tumours are rare fibro-epithelial lesions that account
                for less than 1% of all breast neoplasms [9, 10]. Johannes
                Müller in 1838[11], coined the term Cystosarcoma phyllodes; a
                misnomer as the tumours are rarely cystic and the majority
                follow a benign clinical course. In case of  clinical suspicion,
                the first step in workup is a mammogram which shows a
                hyperdense, large, rounded or lobulated mass with distinct
                margins[12]. Further, breast ultrasound is the imaging modality
                of choice to characterize a breast mass and  a suspected
                phyllodes tumour. Sonographically, not only is it difficult to
                differentiate phyllodes tumour from a fibroadenoma, but the
                ability to grade it is also limited[13]. The role of CT is
                usually to assess for the degree of local invasion, recurrence
                or for the presence of metastasis[13]. Currently, there are few
                reports describing the imaging appearance of osseous phyllodes
                tumour metastases. While metastasis can present as a solid mass
                adjacent to the involved bone, it appears to rapidly infiltrate
                the cortex and medulla resulting in a permeative pattern on
                radiographs. Bone scan may show increased Tc99m-MDP radiotracer
                uptake. MRI may show a diffusely infiltrated bone with complete
                marrow replacement, avid enhancement, cortical destruction and
                significant surrounding soft tissue edema and may better
                delineate the extent of metastasis into the surrounding tissues.
              </p>

              <p>
                The phyllodes tumour is classified based on histological grade
                as benign, borderline or malignant. Grading is by evaluating the
                frequency of mitoses, the characteristics of the tumour margins,
                the stromal cellularity and the degree of atypia[14]. Another
                histological finding which is worrisome for increased
                aggressiveness is stromal overgrowth, defined as the presence of
                stroma without associated epithelial elements over one low power
                (x 40) field[12].
              </p>

              <p>
                With increasing tumour grade, the risk of metastasis also
                increase. Distant metastases develops in 10% overall[15] and 20%
                of histologically malignant tumours. Most distant metastases
                develop without evidence of local recurrence[16]. The commonest
                sites for distant metastases are the lung, bone, and abdominal
                viscera[17, 18]. These often occur in the absence of lymph node
                metastases and histologically contain only the stromal element.
                The risk of metastatic disease is not influenced by the extent
                of the initial surgery and appears to be predetermined by tumour
                biology. Few reports have been published of distant metastases
                after excision of a benign phyllodes tumour, except when
                histologically malignant local recurrence occurs.
              </p>

              <p>
                Regardless of grade, the primary method of treatment is surgical
                - local excision, wide local excision or mastectomy. Wide
                excision is recommended because of the strong tendency for local
                recurrence (upto 20%), even in benign phyllodes tumours.
                Secondary treatments include adjuvant radiotherapy and/or
                chemotherapy. As they undergo haematogenous spread, the
                proportion of patients with lymph node metastases is
                approximately 10% and routine axillary clearance is not
                recommended. Metastatic phyllodes tumours have a poor prognosis
                and no long term survival studies has been reported.
                Suzuki-Uematsu et al. reviewed 15 cases of malignant PTs and
                described a five year survival rate following primary surgery of
                10% while the 2.2 year survival rate following detection of
                metastasis was 11%. Isolated reports have been published of good
                palliation of metastatic disease from single agent or
                combination chemotherapy[19, 20] but the exact role of
                chemotherapy in metastatic phyllodes tumours remains to be
                defined.
