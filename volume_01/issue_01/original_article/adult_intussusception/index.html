                Intussusception is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction in

              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>
                Intestinal intussusception is rare in adults, accounting for 1
                to 5 percent of mechanical bowel obstructions [1,2] and less
                than 5% of the total cases of intussusceptions[3]. It often
                poses clinicians with a diagnostic conundrum owing to its
                varying presentations. 
              </p>

              <p>
                By definition it is the telescoping or invagination of one
                segment of gut into another. This is predominantly in a proximal
                to distal direction, that of the natural physiological
                peristaltic process.
              </p>

              <p>
                The aetiology has multiple dimensions to its description. These
                include its location in the gastrointestinal tract, presence or
                absence of a physical or functional initiating lesion (the lead
                point) and the behavioural characteristics of this lead point,
                be it benign or malignant. The manifestations of intussusception
                fall anywhere between an acute and chronic intestinal
                obstruction. Etiologically it can be classified into primary or
                secondary type. Intussusceptions with no clear lead point are
                the primary or idiopathic type, present in 8%–20% of cases, and
                more likely to occur in the small intestine [4,5]. The secondary
                type, constituting the greater majority, is due to an existing
                gut pathological lesion - a lead point: a functional or
                structural lesion associated with the intussusceptum, postulated
                to be the ‘trigger’ for intussusception. The commonest ‘lead
                points’ are colonic malignant tumours, [60%]. Benign tumours
                constitute the majority of the remaining 40%.

              <h3>Case Details</h3>
              <p>
                A 55 year old perimenopausal female, with no comorbidities and
                without any past abdominal surgeries other than a post-partum
                sterilization 18 yrs back, presented with left sided colicky
                abdominal pain associated with multiple episodes  bilious
                vomiting and constipation for 2 days. She had simililar episodes
                in the past which responded to conservative management. There
                was no history of weight loss/ loss of appetite/malena/
                hematochezia/ abdominal distention. As she was having recurrent
                episodes, she underwent diagnostic laproscopy with adhesiolysis
                from a private hospital. Pain recurred along with constipation
                and vomiting after one month of the procedure. On examination,
                vitals were stable . Abdominal examination revealed a distended
                abdomen with a vague non tender mass in left lumbar region about
                5x5 cm. Bowel sounds were absent. Rectal examination showed no
                ballooning or active bleeding, or any mass palpable. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Erect abdominal radiograph showed dilated bowel loops that
                prompted a CECT abdomen, which showed typical target sign - the
                bowel in bowel appearance in the left iliac fossa; part of
                descending colon invaginating into sigmoid colon with wall
                thickening. Colonoscopy showed globulated swelling at splenic
                flexure 6x6 cm. Biopsy report was that of a moderately
                differentiated adeno carcinoma. Except for mild elevation of CEA
                - 4.41 [0-3.4 ng/ml], the rest of her investigations were
                normal. We went ahead with laprotomy that disclosed an annular
                constricting growth in lower part of descending colon
                telescoping into the sigmiod. Proximal descending colon and
                transverse colon were dilated and there were extensive omental
                adhesions to the parietal wall. Liver and the rest of viscera
                were normal and there was no ascites. Left hemicolectomy with an
                end to end anastomosis of transverse colon to the rectum was
                done. Post-op period was uneventful and she was discharged.
              </p>

              <p>
                Histopathology showed a signet cell carcinoma of the colon
                measuring 9x 5x 2.8 cm involving the entire thickness of the
                wall infiltrating the serosa.  Adjacent mesocolon showed
                secondary deposits. Resected margins were tumor free. 7/7 lymph
                nodes were positive. Also perineural and lymphatic invasion were
                noted.

              <h3>Discussion</h3>
              <p>
                The first report of intussusception was made in 1674 by Barbette
                of Amsterdam. Intussusception or "introsusception" as it was
                called then, was in addition detailed in 1789 by John Hunter[6].
                In 1871 Sir Jonathan Hutchinson was the first to successfully
                operate on a child with intussusceptions[7]. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Adult intussusception occurs infrequently and differs from the
                childhood condition in its presentation, aetiology, and
                treatment. 
              </p>

              <p>
                The common intussusceptions have been classified into four
                categories according to the site of origin: enteric, ileocolic,
                ileocaecal, and colonic. Enteric and colonic cases are those
                that are confined to the small and large intestine respectively.
                While ileocolic intussusceptions are those with prolapse of the
                ileum into the colon through the ileocaecal valve, ileocaecal
                intussusceptions occur when the ileocaecal valve acts as the
                lead point. 
              </p>

              <p>
                However, in clinical practice it is difficult to differentiate
                between ileocolic and ileocaecal types. The presenting symptoms
                in adults are non-specific and often long standing. Most series
                report pain as the commonest symptom, [71% to 90%]  followed by
                vomiting and bleeding from the rectum. Abdominal mass is noted
                in 24% to 42% of cases.
              </p>

              <p>
                Diagnosis can be delayed because of its longstanding,
                intermittent, and non-specific symptoms and most cases are
                diagnosed at an emergency laparotomy. It is thus important to
                have a high index of suspicion.  With more frequent use of
                computed tomography in the evaluation of patients with abdominal
                pain, the condition can be diagnosed more reliably. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Treatment requires resection of the involved bowel without
                attempted reduction in colonic lesions or in small bowel cases
                where the bowel is nonviable or where malignancy is suspected.
                With gastroduodenal and coloanal intussusceptions the surgical
                technique may need modification according to the situation and
                can be challenging.
